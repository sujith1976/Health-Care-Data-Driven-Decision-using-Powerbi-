# Health-Care-Data-Driven-Decision-using-Powerbi-

In this project, we have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard tailored for healthcare professionals to leverage patient data for strategic decision-making. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total patients, average ICU duration, and gender distribution, alongside interactive graphs for in-depth analysis.

Features:

KPIs: Monitor critical metrics including total patients, average duration of stay in the ICU, and gender distribution.
Interactive Graphs: Explore patient demographics and trends with graphs depicting total patients by age group and by weeknames.
Tree-like Graph: Dive deeper into data relationships with a visually intuitive tree-like graph for further analysis.


We believe that this dashboard will empower healthcare stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance patient outcomes. Thank you for visiting our repository, and we look forward to your feedback and contributions!
